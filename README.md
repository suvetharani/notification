## ðŸ“š Tutorial

Follow this post to understand how the project works and how you can build your own push notification system using Flutter and Firebase.


## âœ… How It Works

* On launch, Firebase initializes and generates a device token.
* This token is used to send push notifications.
* Notifications are handled when app is:

  * Open (foreground)
  * In background
  * Terminated

## ðŸ’¡ Learnings

From this project, Iâ€™ve strengthened my understanding of:

* Firebase integration in Flutter
* Notification behavior across app states
* Real-time communication and token management
